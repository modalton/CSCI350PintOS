			PAGE TABLE MANAGEMENT
			=====================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

struct page_entry
{
	void* vaddr;
	
	struct file* file;
	uint32_t read_bytes;
	uint32_t zero_bytes;
	off_t offset;

	uint8_t dirty_bit;
	bool writeable;
	bool loaded;
	enum entry_type type;

	size_t swap_slot_index;


	struct hash_elem hash_elem;
};

This is the main data structure entry for tracking these basic page characteristics. A hash table of these entries is kept for each thread in thier supplementary hash table.

struct frame_elem
{
	//do i need addr like pintos ex?
	void* frame;
	uint32_t* addr;
	struct page_entry* page_entry;
	uint32_t* pagedir;
	struct hash_elem hash_elem;
};

This is a frame elem, kept in a master global frame table. Has a pointer to which page entry is using it. While a list would've made for a more accurate LRU, I used a hash table for speed.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: In a few paragraphs, describe your code for locating the frame,
>> if any, that contains the data of a given page.

We'll take the rounded down user virtual address and look it up in our processes supplemental page table. This will give us the entry and then we use frame_alloc to grab us a frame. This is where we will locate the frame; the function will evict a frame is none are available or it will just do a normal allocation. Install page will put them together.

>> A3: How does your code coordinate accessed and dirty bits between
>> kernel and user virtual addresses that alias a single frame, or
>> alternatively how do you avoid the issue?

We use virtual addresses in kernel space, proper vaddr exception handling, and the supplemental page table to load pages so we actually avoid this. 

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: When two user processes both need a new frame at the same time,
>> how are races avoided?
I actually thing the palloc.h functions we use in frame_alloc have locks to preseve thier state so we dont have to worry about races. But just in case we have a master frame table lock used for evictions and allocations

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A5: Why did you choose the data structure(s) that you did for
>> representing virtual-to-physical mappings?

The implementation slides were pretty clear that alot of these data structures needed to be sepereate, thread safe, communicable, and organized so this explains pretty much every seperate data structure and the variables they need to maintain to fulfill these requirements

		       PAGING TO AND FROM DISK
		       =======================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

*see frame entry above

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B2: When a frame is required but none is free, some frame must be
>> evicted.  Describe your code for choosing a frame to evict.

We scan through and check if it's accessed and dirty, if not so we have eviction candidates. On the scan it it's not both then we flip the accessed bit so on another we can potentially get another hit. This isn't a perfect LRU because I used a hash table but it's pretty close

>> B3: When a process P obtains a frame that was previously used by a
>> process Q, how do you adjust the page table (and any other data
>> structures) to reflect the frame Q no longer has?

>> B4: Explain your heuristic for deciding whether a page fault for an
>> invalid virtual address should cause the stack to be extended into
>> the page that faulted.

With push being the biggest allowed @ 32 bytes below the stack pointer, any virtual address in that range will be valid, anything below invalid. So if we have addr in range and our stack is in growable range we are allowed to grow it to make room for new memory

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B5: Explain the basics of your VM synchronization design.  In
>> particular, explain how it prevents deadlock.  (Refer to the
>> textbook for an explanation of the necessary conditions for
>> deadlock.)

>> B6: A page fault in process P can cause another process Q's frame
>> to be evicted.  How do you ensure that Q cannot access or modify
>> the page during the eviction process?  How do you avoid a race
>> between P evicting Q's frame and Q faulting the page back in?

>> B7: Suppose a page fault in process P causes a page to be read from
>> the file system or swap.  How do you ensure that a second process Q
>> cannot interfere by e.g. attempting to evict the frame while it is
>> still being read in?

>> B8: Explain how you handle access to paged-out pages that occur
>> during system calls.  Do you use page faults to bring in pages (as
>> in user programs), or do you have a mechanism for "locking" frames
>> into physical memory, or do you use some other design?  How do you
>> gracefully handle attempted accesses to invalid virtual addresses?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: A single lock for the whole VM system would make
>> synchronization easy, but limit parallelism.  On the other hand,
>> using many locks complicates synchronization and raises the
>> possibility for deadlock but allows for high parallelism.  Explain
>> where your design falls along this continuum and why you chose to
>> design it this way.

			 MEMORY MAPPED FILES
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: Describe how memory mapped files integrate into your virtual
>> memory subsystem.  Explain how the page fault and eviction
>> processes differ between swap pages and other pages.

>> C3: Explain how you determine whether a new file mapping overlaps
>> any existing segment.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> C4: Mappings created with "mmap" have similar semantics to those of
>> data demand-paged from executables, except that "mmap" mappings are
>> written back to their original files, not to swap.  This implies
>> that much of their implementation can be shared.  Explain why your
>> implementation either does or does not share much of the code for
>> the two situations.

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.
